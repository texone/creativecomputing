/**
 * An instance of this class is used to generate a stream of 
 * pseudorandom numbers. The class uses a 48-bit seed, which is 
 * modified using a linear congruential formula.
 * 
 * If two instances of <code>CCRandom</code> are created with the same 
 * seed, and the same sequence of method calls is made for each, they 
 * will generate and return identical sequences of numbers. In order to 
 * guarantee this property, particular algorithms are specified for the 
 * class <tt>Random</tt>. Java implementations must use all the algorithms 
 * shown here for the class <tt>Random</tt>, for the sake of absolute 
 * portability of Java code. However, subclasses of class <tt>Random</tt> 
 * are permitted to use other algorithms, so long as they adhere to the 
 * general contracts for all the methods.
 * <p>
 * The algorithms implemented by class <tt>Random</tt> use a 
 * <tt>protected</tt> utility method that on each invocation can supply 
 * up to 32 pseudorandomly generated bits.
 * <p>
 * Many applications will find the <code>random</code> method in 
 * class <code>Math</code> simpler to use.
